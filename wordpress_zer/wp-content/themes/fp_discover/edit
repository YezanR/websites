Edit:

	Problem in plugin Blue Wrench :

		In file lib/BlueWrenchVideoController.php 

				- $url_chunks = parse_url($video_url);
				- $url['path'] doesn't return the correct Video Id for youtube, 
				  to solve this problem :
						$url_parts = explode('=', $url_chunks['query']);
						$ur_parts[1] now contains the correct video Id to embed the video in <iframe> tag
